## Introduction

Is a WebGL based 3D engine for my personal experiments.



### Features ###
- Skinning Animation
- Lighting (Direct, Point, Spotlight, Hemispherics)
- Shadow mapping (VSM)
- Bump mapping
- Basic primitives (Cube, Cylinder, Plane, Sphere, Coordinate)
- Camera (Orbit Control)
- Bounding box
- Loaders  
 - Ogre loader ([Script](https://github.com/games/OgreToJson))
 - [GLTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF)(based spec0.6, Meshes+Textures+Skin+Animation) 
 - OBJ Loader(Only support vertices & indices)
 - [BabylonJS](https://github.com/BabylonJS/) loader (Basic)
- Physics engine (Use [Cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js))
- Fog
- Skybox
- Reflection texture (Spheric, planar, cubic and projection)
- Create mesh from height map
- Water
- Particle System
- Physically based render (not finish yet)


### TODO ###
- Code refactoring
- Scene graph
- Picking
- Billboarding
- Post-processes
- Lens flares
- First person camera control
- Morph targets
- LOD system
- Sub Mesh
- New physics plugin [ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js)
